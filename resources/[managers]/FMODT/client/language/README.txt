To change the language from English to German, open the FMODT\client\language\German (Deutsch) - Folder and
copy the file in there to this location: FMODT\client\language.

To change it to any other language open the language.lua - File located at FMODT\client\language and
translate every string (everything between them: "") and save the file.

If you want to, send me the file at the forum and I will add it to the thread.
